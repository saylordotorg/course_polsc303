     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read this entire
    entry.  This reading will introduce you to different definitions and
    ways of conceptualizing feminism.  Indeed, there are many approaches
    and definitions within feminist philosophy and practice, some
    overlapping and some competing with one another.  The reading also
    presents a number of broad theoretical concerns that motivate
    feminist scholars.  This reading should take you approximately 1

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read this entire
    entry.  Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores
    theories of knowledge.  When people ask questions about how we know
    what we know, they are engaging in epistemological questions.  As
    the reading indicates, there are several approaches to feminist
    epistemology – feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism,
    and feminist empiricism – but all take as a core assumption that sex
    plays a role in the production and interpretation of theories of
    knowledge.  Later sections of this reading address feminist
    critiques of science and the argument that scientific inquiry has
    historically been conducted from a distinctly male perspective and
    informed by sometimes biased masculine values.  This reading should
    take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

    Self”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-self/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    entry.  Conceptions of the self are important to feminist
    philosophers.  A distinctly male notion of identity has prevailed
    throughout much of Western intellectual history, and the female self
    has been seen as “Other.”  Feminists have sought to define and
    situate a female self both in the context of the male identity and,
    in some cases, in opposition to male identity.  This reading will
    take you approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete.

    notes should take you approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to

    as writers and editors at Ms. Magazine.  Ms., founded by Gloria
    Steinem in 1971, was the first major feminist magazine in the U.S.

    article.  Make sure to click on the “Next” link at the end of the
    article to read all 6 pages.  In the summer of 2012, an article in
    *The Atlantic* about the ongoing difficulty women face in balancing
    careers and family received a great deal of media attention.  Some
    complained that the author focused only on women with advanced
    degrees in professional positions.  Others praised the article for
    asking why men do not seem to struggle as much with balancing career
    and family.  Whether you agree with the author or not, the key
    questions she raises have informed feminist discussions about work,
    family, and class for over a century.  This reading should take you
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the links above, and read these
    articles in their entirety.  Sometimes in political and cultural
    discussions of feminism, calls for gender equality in education and
    the workforce are presented as supporting a privileged or superior
    position for women and girls.  Thus, there is often a backlash in
    defense of male equality, suggesting that female progress comes at
    the expense of fairness for men.  The first article represents this
    perspective.  The second counters the notion that feminism
    represents reverse sexism.  These readings should take you
    approximately 1 hour to complete.
