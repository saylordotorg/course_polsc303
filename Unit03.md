**Unit 3: Second Wave Feminism** <span id="3"></span> 
*Though the exact dates of the Second Wave of the feminist movement are
disputed, most agree that it began in the 1960s and lasted through the
early 1990s.  Whereas the First Wave addressed political equality,
activists in the Second Wave addressed cultural as well as political
issues.  The mantra that “the personal is political” really came alive
in the Second Wave.  For instance, while at the same time seeking an
equal rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Second Wave also
focused on representations of women in advertising.  The Second Wave,
which began with concerns about gender equality at work and in the home,
ended with a debate within the feminist movement over how to define
sexual exploitation.*

    published her column, originally titled “Homeward Bound,” in *The

    a conversation about the changing roles of working men and women in
    the home.  Some criticized Hirshman’s methodology; others criticized
    her suggestion that women are smart to marry “beneath their own pay
    grade.”  Some championed her call for men to help working women
    break the glass ceiling at home, while some men insisted that
    Hirshman was not giving them enough credit for the work they were
    already doing at home.

    about the role of women and men in the home shifted in the last

    Hirshman’s main arguments.  Why?
