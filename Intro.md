Comprehending the role that feminism has played in identifying,
critiquing, and, at times, altering the distribution of political and
economic power is integral to understanding democratic citizenship and
government.  In this course, we will examine the history of feminist
thought, beginning in the late eighteenth century and continuing through
the early twenty-first century.  An overarching goal of this course is
to encourage you to develop and shape your own concepts and ideas about
feminist political thought as a potent and multifaceted global force. 
In working toward this goal, we begin the course by defining feminism
and engaging with some of the cultural and political stereotypes of
feminism and feminist thinking in contemporary politics and popular
culture.  Next, we explore the history of feminist thinking.  We
conclude by examining current topics in feminist politics. Throughout
the course, we will examine and discuss questions important to feminist
politics, such as citizenship, political participation, and political
rights; work and family; reproductive rights and birth control; gender
representation in the media; and finally, the role of gender in
militarism and national security.  In considering each topic, we will
draw on historical analysis and seek to consider the variety of women’s
experiences.  Though this course will focus on feminism in the U.S., we
will also attempt to incorporate international perspectives on women and
feminism. Finally, it is important to note that our course materials
are, by their very nature, political.  They are not, however, political
in a narrowly partisan sense.  Feminist theory does presume that gender
inequality is unjust.  Nevertheless, you are free to challenge and
disagree with this presumption, just as you are encouraged to critically
evaluate all of the arguments advanced in materials presented in the
course.
