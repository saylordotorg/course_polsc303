**Unit 2: First Wave Feminism** <span id="2"></span> 
*Historians tend to divide the feminist movement into three waves. 
Though there is not a strong consensus on the exact dates defining each
wave, we can safely make some generalizations.  The First Wave of
feminism occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
The overarching goal of this wave was demand for more opportunities for
women, with a particular focus on suffrage.  The Second Wave started in
the 1960s and continued into the early 1990s.  This wave was informed by
anti-war and civil rights movements, as well as by the growing
self-consciousness of minority groups around the world.  The Third Wave
of feminism started in the mid-1990s and focuses on poststructuralist
notions of gender, the body, and sexuality.  Though there are
alternative ways to organize the study of feminist politics, for the
bulk of this course we will engage with each wave of feminism along this
chronological pathway, ending with issues that fuel feminist politics
today.  
  
 he First Wave of feminism had its origin in the European Enlightenment,
but it was not until the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft’s “A
Vindication of the Rights of Woman” that the movement really gained
momentum.  We will read Wollstonecraft’s thesis, as well as the writings
of several other early feminist theorists.  Additionally, we will engage
with many of the key issues of the First Wave, which focused on
political equality and citizens’ rights, including voting rights
(suffrage), ownership of private property, and access to education.  It
is important to note that many First Wave feminists, including
Wollstonecraft and Susan B. Anthony, would likely be considered
politically conservative today.  This is not true of Emma Goldman, who
we will also discuss in this unit.*
