**Unit 4: Third Wave Feminism** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look at the Third Wave of the feminist movement,
which challenged fundamental assumptions about the category of “woman”
and criticized the class disparity that existed within the feminist
movement itself.  Separating questions of gender from questions of sex,
Third Wave feminists often argued that the category of “woman” was
itself socially constructed.  This critique of “essentialism” and
“reductivism” developed out of the broader poststructuralist movement in
political theory.  It focused on images of bodies, medical discourse,
and the reduction of complex identities to gender.  It also explored the
ways in which language had led to reductive understandings of gender
categories and asked how gender difference relates to race and class
difference.  Building on these critiques, the Third Wave addressed how
the Second Wave feminist movement had ignored the diversity within its
own ranks.*

**4.1 Poststructuralist Theories of Power** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Michel Foucault’s understanding of power is very helpful in thinking
about the Third Wave with its critique of the category of “woman” or
“feminine.”  Foucault did not set out to write feminist theory, and not
all Third Wave feminists are Foucauldians, but this way of thinking
about power helps provide background to the thinking of some Third Wave
feminism.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Chapter 4 in
    its entirety.  Biological differences between men and women were
    said to be of little significance in First Wave feminism.  Second
    Wave feminists acknowledged biological differences – in particular,
    women’s reproductive capacities – and suggested that men should take
    a larger role at home and in childrearing.  Third Wave feminists
    also point to biological differences between men and women but draw
    on medical research demonstrating more commonalities than
    differences.  This chapter on the socialization processes inherent
    to gender and sex offers an academic discussion of sex and gender
    differences and will provide you with useful background for future
    readings.  This reading should take you approximately 1 hour to
    complete.

    Politics”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: A Foucauldian notion of power helps us in thinking
    about gender as something socially constructed.  Scholars of
    identity politics argue that sex is a social construction, too, but
    not all Third Wave feminists go that far.  Read the entire entry on
    “Identity Politics.”   Note in the “Gender and Feminism” section
    that Judith Butler argues that if “woman” and “feminine” are social
    constructions, and if identity in general is socially constructed,
    then Third Wave feminism leads us to ask why we privilege “woman”
    and the “feminine.”  This reading should take you approximately 2
    hours to complete.
